  <h3>Using ABAP memory to pass on your own internal table in exit.</h3>

<p>Exits comes handy when the standard functions that don't quite provide what we require. They are the little loop holes for us to implement our own codes
inside the standard SAP programs. You can just use the global variables and intenal tables and by changing them to suit your needs. 
While the global vaiables and tables are there for you, you are not able to create your own global values. For example, you want to store 
the number of times of changes and increment the value everytime the changes occur but no such variable exists (Unless you take a least used variable and 
mark the incremented number there, which is not recomennded as it is still SAP standard variable. You never know what it is used for later in the standard code).
I went through painstaking process and found out that you can use ABAP memory to pass your necessary values. It's like summoning a vortex and passing the value, whenever needed 
summon the vortex again to retreat it.</br>
In this section, I will use user exit "USEREXIT_PRICING_PREPARE_TKOMP" in program MV45AFZZ. It's triggered when price is added/changed in sales order.
